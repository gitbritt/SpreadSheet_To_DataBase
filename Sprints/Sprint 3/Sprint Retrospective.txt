Sprint retrospective
--------------------
What worked:
understang that there was an issue with reuploading the data. I was able to come up with a quick solution
that solves the reuploading issue.
Tests have passed manually.
Everything is mostly done (with a few things).

What did not go as well:
Checking in several times a week.
Became hard because of graduation + job hunt + and school.
