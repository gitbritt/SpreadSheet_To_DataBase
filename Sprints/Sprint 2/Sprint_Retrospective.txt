What went well
--------------
Inplementing the Excel libaray
reading CSV
Checking in at least 3 times a week and have deticated time outside of class
keeping trello uptodate
Staying motivated



What did not go well
--------------------
I noticed how I was going to tackle the excel portion did not work at all after I thought I had it all working


What can be done to improve
---------------------------
Just because it says how to do it in my paper last semester, does not mean it is alwayse the best method.
Double check to see it that is really the best way to go about things.
