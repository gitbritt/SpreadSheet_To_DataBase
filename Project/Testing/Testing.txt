Testing

Sprint 1
Unit Testing
------------
Connecting to DB,
	The program connects to the local database. I the DB name comes from text input from user(It has a default name for testing)
	If the name's is changed, it fails connection, unless the DB name is changed as well.
	Same goes with the HOST
	
Populating table dropdown
	The dropdown list get info from SQL command that get all table names witin the chosen DB.
	When I switch the DB name to what SQL origiannly had as the default, it brings up table names from that DB
	Gets nothing when there are no tables
	
	
Preview
	Preview Database gets 1st row so the user can see whats going on in the database side of things.
	This is an SQL command that displays first row of the table selected. if there is nothign selected the program will crash right now
	When changed to a new table, hit preview again and it updates
	

System Testing
--------------
This is where all parts so far work together

	Connection has to happen first (Bseides the GUI deisgn )
	When the connect button is clicked, connection is successful.
	
	
	When the other buttons envolving DB interactions are clicked first, the program fails.
	
	When connect it clicked, the Selected table list is auto set to the first one in the list.
	Preview get the Selected table.
